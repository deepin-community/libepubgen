* All generators
- Handle drawing objects (convert to SVG images?)
- Handle embedded fonts.
- Handle embedded images.
- Handle embedded documents.
- Implement "best" splitting method.
- Put footnotes into separate file(s).
- Handle links.

* Text generator
- Implement text splitting based on chapters (requres explicitly marked headings
  in the input).

* Drawing generators
- Handle master pages.
- Sort objects for output by their position on the page. Currently they are
  emitted in the same order they have been received, which, if the library is
  used directly with one of the import libraries, can be completely random. This
  implies handling of master pages and layers.
- Make size-based splitting work.
